# Database and OS security of the HR system of a company

LO1: Design and develop database solutions for real world applications.<br>
LO2: Apply relational query languages and database programming languages in database
applications.<br>
LO3: Evaluate query plans and recommend solutions to speed up the database servers.<br>
LO4: Apply appropriate solutions to address security and performance concerns related to
databases<br>

**Task 1 – OS Security**
1. Compare and contrast 5 Linux distributions and select and justify the most suitable
one to be used as the OS for this server.
2. Install that distribution on a machine.
3. Analyze the security risks faced by this server and Identify at least 10 configurations
you must do to harden that distribution and explain why it increases the security and
the attacks it protects against and carry those out.
4. Use diagrams to document and explain each of the configurations you have done.

**Task 2 – Database Security**
1. Install the oracle DBMS on the machine on the Linux distribution you installed.
2. Identify 5 configurations you must do to harden that distribution and explain why it
increases the security and the attacks it protects against and carry those out.
3. Implement a suitable simple ERD suitable to be used in a HR system in that database
and enter appropriate sample data.
a. Should be a minimum of 5 tables with more than 5 attributes each.
b. Should include 1:M and M:N relationships
c. Each table should include at least 10 records of sample data.
4. The roles of people accessing this database can be System Admin, Manager and
Executive. Create the 3 users in the DBMS and allocate the below roles/user
permissions to them.
a. System Admin – Full permissions including all system permissions.
b. Manager – No system permissions, only allowed to read from and write to the
database.
c. Executive - No system permissions, only allowed to read from the database.
5. Create a view that allows Managers to view the personal and salary details of the
people who work for them.
6. Create a VPD that matches the functionality of the view required in the above
question.
7. Identify a subset of the data in your database that requires higher security and encrypt
that data with suitable encryption options.
8. If you were to allow access to the database for a consulting firm identify potentially
sensitive/private information and mask that data appropriately.
9. Identify and implement a suitable FGA policy for your database.

**Task 3 – Big Data Security**
1. Carryout a lit review of the security issues faced when using big data and what can be
done to mitigate those risks.
  a. Identify the main security requirements of big data and highlight how they
differ from the security requirements of traditional databases.
  b. Identify and explain 5 common attacks that can be mounted on big data
systems.
  c. Identify and explain at least 2 security controls to mitigate each attack.
